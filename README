Bash script to automatically install and configure an openHAB system (Z-Wave and HABmin preconfigured)

The script has been succesfully tested on a Raspberry Pi, but it should work on any Debian based (Ubuntu) distribution.

The script installs the following packages:

- Java 8 (latest version from repository)
- openhab-runtime (1.8.3)
- Z-Wave binding (1.10.0-SNAPSHOT)
- Udev rule for Aeon Labs Z-Stick Gen2 and Gen5
- HABmin (1.7.0-SNAPSHOT)

Enjoy!
